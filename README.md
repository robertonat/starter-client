# Starter code for CRUD App

Same as the server repository. I only uploaded the files that were in the original starter code and no node modules because I thought that might be what youre more interested in. Hopefully that isnt an issue. I was able to do most of the requirements but was not able to implement removing students and adding them in editing a campus unfortunately. Thanks for the semester!
